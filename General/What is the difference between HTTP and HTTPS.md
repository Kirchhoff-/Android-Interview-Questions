# HTTP vs HTTPS

**HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** - is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. **HTTP** is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser. **HTTP** offers set of rules and standards which govern how any information can be transmitted on the World Wide Web. **HTTP** provides standard rules for web browsers & servers to communicate.

**HTTP** is an application layer network protocol which is built on top of TCP. **HTTP** uses Hypertext structured text which establishes the logical link between nodes containing text. It is also known as "stateless protocol" as each command is executed separately, without using reference of previous run command.

**HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)** - is an extension of the **HTTP** . It is used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet. In **HTTPS**, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or, formerly, its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).

The principal motivations for **HTTPS** are authentication of the accessed website, protection of the privacy and integrity of the exchanged data while in transit. It protects against man-in-the-middle attacks. The bidirectional encryption of communications between a client and server protects against eavesdropping and tampering of the communication. In practice, this provides a reasonable assurance that one is communicating without interference by attackers with the website that one intended to communicate with, as opposed to an impostor.

| HTTP | HTTPS |
|---|---|
| It uses port 80 by default  | It was use port 443 by default  |
| URLs begin with *http://*  | URLs begin with *https://*  |
| No encryption before sending data.  | Data encrypted before sending |
| Website don't need SSL | Website need SSL |
| Works at Application Layer  | Works at Transport Layer  |
