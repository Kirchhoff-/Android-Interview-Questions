# Google Images Search

Create an application that performs image search using Google Images Search (or Custom Google Search).
1. The main screen consists of two tabs:
- **Search**. On this tab, the user can enter a query and view the results in a list;
- **Favorites**. A list of images that the user has added to favorites.

2. Each list item should include the following elements:
- An image;
- A title;
- A checkbox to add the image to favorites.

3. Display search results in batches of 10 items and implement lazy loading to fetch additional data when scrolling to the end (where appropriate).

4. Add functionality to save user-selected results in a local database.

5. On clicking an image, open a new screen to display the image with zoom functionality.

6. You can use any libraries/tools to implement the task.
